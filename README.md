## About

Hi, I’m Elissa Esterlein — a data analyst with a background in biology and medical research and a strong interest in applying data-driven insights to public policy, housing, land use, and community systems.

My work spans exploratory analysis, dashboards, internal automation tools, and lightweight web applications. I’m especially interested in transparency, reproducibility, and designing tools that make complex systems easier to understand for both technical and non-technical users.

I’m actively building through real-world projects, certifications, and public datasets, and I’m excited to contribute to mission-driven organizations as a thoughtful, adaptable data analyst.

## Workplace Automation & Internal Tools

### Local LLM Knowledge Assistant
**Code:** https://github.com/Eesterlein/Building-Local-LLMs-for-Private-Workflows

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate how organizations can deploy private, on-device AI assistants for internal knowledge use without exposing data to third-party APIs.

**Description:**  
Built a locally hosted LLM chatbot using Ollama and LlamaIndex that simulates an internal policy assistant trained on company handbooks and PDFs. The tool uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions entirely offline, making it suitable for sensitive or regulated environments.

**Skills:**  
Prompt engineering • Vector indexing • RAG pipelines • Local AI deployment • Knowledge systems design

**Technology:**  
Python, Ollama, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Markdown  
*(FastAPI integration planned)*

**Results:**  
Delivered a working proof-of-concept showing how organizations can replace cloud-based chat tools with private, auditable AI assistants while maintaining strong answer quality.

### MLS Photo Processor
**Code:** https://github.com/Eesterlein/MLS-Photo-Processor  

**Goal:**  
Automate the renaming, sorting, and classification of MLS property photos for assessor and appraisal workflows.

**Description:**  
A local desktop utility that matches user-provided parcel numbers to internal account records and uses a vision-language model (CLIP) to automatically classify photos (e.g., Kitchen, Exterior, Bathroom). The tool converts unstructured, randomly named downloads into standardized, system-ready files with no manual data entry.

**Skills:**  
Zero-shot image classification • Desktop GUI development • File system automation • Data mapping

**Technology:**  
Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face (CLIP), Pandas, Tkinter, Pillow

**Results:**  
Eliminated manual renaming for high-volume photo sets. The tool uses conservative classification, defaulting to “Other” when confidence is low, ensuring reliable file naming compatible with local government systems.

### Gunnison County Property Analysis Map
**Code:** https://github.com/Eesterlein/gunnison_gis_mapping_static_demo  
**Live Demo:** https://eesterlein.github.io/gunnison_gis_mapping_static_demo/html_map/

**Goal:**  
Provide appraisers and GIS analysts with a fast, visual method to identify data gaps and valuation inconsistencies across Gunnison County.

**Description:**  
A lightweight web mapping application that joins assessment CSVs with GeoJSON parcel boundaries. Users can dynamically style parcels by quality, view, or value to surface missing or outlier data during valuation review.

**Skills:**  
Geospatial joins • Thematic mapping • Front-end web development • Data QA

**Technology:**  
JavaScript (ES6+), Leaflet.js, HTML5/CSS3, GeoJSON, CSV

**Results:**  
Achieved 97% parcel coverage by merging multiple data sources, enabling faster spatial auditing of county property records.

### Zillow Property & Photo Scraper *(In Development)*
**Code:** https://github.com/Eesterlein/zillow-photo-scraper-scraperapi  

**Goal:**  
Automate extraction of property metadata and images from Zillow for appraisal and market analysis.

**Description:**  
A Python-based scraping utility using ScraperAPI to retrieve listing data and images, with fuzzy address matching to auto-organize downloads into account-level folders. Currently being refactored to use Playwright + Chromium for improved stability.

**Skills:**  
Web scraping architecture • API integration • Data normalization • Asset automation

**Technology:**  
Python, Requests, Pandas, JSON, BeautifulSoup (Playwright planned)

**Results:**  
Built a batch-processing pipeline that significantly reduced manual effort for compiling subject property photo sets.
