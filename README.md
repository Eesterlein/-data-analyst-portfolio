# Elissa Esterlein ‚Äì Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Elissa. I bring a background in biology and medical research to the field of data analytics, with a strong interest in applying data-driven insights to health, environment, and public policy challenges.

After stepping away from research to raise my child and live off-grid in the Colorado Rockies, I‚Äôve reignited my technical skills through modern tools like Python, geospatial analysis, and AI-assisted workflows. My passion for learning, curiosity about complex systems, and drive to uncover meaningful patterns have made data science an exciting new chapter in my career.

This portfolio showcases my work across a variety of domains ‚Äî from exploring land ownership trends in Colorado, to building lightweight AI tools, to tracking real-time flight data near Gunnison Airport. These projects reflect my growing expertise in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling through code.

I'm actively building my skills through certifications, real-world projects, and public data challenges ‚Äî and I‚Äôm excited to contribute to mission-driven organizations as a flexible, creative, and thoughtful data analyst.

## Portfolio Projects  
In this section, I list data analytics and AI projects with brief summaries and links to source code or hosted reports.

---

### Garmin Fitness Data Analysis  
**Code:** [Garmin Fitness Analysis Repository](https://github.com/Eesterlein/My-2024-Garmin-Data-Analysis-)  
**Live Report:** [GitHub Pages Site](https://eesterlein.github.io/My-2024-Garmin-Data-Analysis-/)

**Goal:** To uncover patterns in personal health data using Garmin fitness exports.

**Description:** This project explores trends in activity, calories, heart rate, sleep, and stress over the course of 2024. Using Python, I analyzed and visualized seasonality, correlations, and wellness insights from raw Garmin data.

**Skills:** data wrangling, time series analysis, statistical correlation, data storytelling.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Results:** Revealed a strong correlation between activity and calorie burn (0.89), seasonal changes in workout intensity, and a moderate link between resting heart rate and stress.

---

### Building Local Language Models  
**Code:** [Local LLM Chatbot Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/Building-Local-LLMs-for-Private-Workflows)

**Goal:** To create a privacy-first AI assistant using locally hosted large language models (LLMs).

**Description:** Built a demo app using Ollama, LlamaIndex, and LangChain that simulates a policy chatbot trained on company handbooks. The agent can answer questions locally without needing an internet connection.

**Skills:** vector database indexing, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, local AI hosting.  
**Technology:** Python, Ollama, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Markdown, FastAPI (planned).

**Results:** Demonstrated how companies can use on-device models for internal knowledge queries without sharing data externally.

### Colorado Land Ownership   
**Code:** [Colorado Land Ownership GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/colorado-land-ownership)  
**Live Report:** [GitHub Pages Site](https://eesterlein.github.io/colorado-land-ownership/)

**Goal:** To analyze the distribution of public vs. private land ownership across Colorado and explore trends in absentee ownership.

**Description:** This geospatial project combines COMaP shapefiles, parcel data, and assessor records to visualize land control by agency, ownership type, and residency.

**Skills:** geospatial analysis, public land data, mapping, data cleaning, visualization, storytelling.  
**Technology:** Python, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, ArcGIS, GitHub Pages.

**Results:** Found that 62.6% of Colorado is privately owned; in counties like Gunnison, over 76% is public land, but private parcels are increasingly owned by out-of-county residents and investment entities.

---

### US State-level Demographics Snapshot
**Code:** [US State-level Demographics Snapshot Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/us-state-demographics-sql-acs2019)  
**Live Report:** [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/mNjbN_gsXoQ)

**Goal:**  
To analyze state-level socioeconomic indicators using U.S. Census ACS data and uncover patterns in poverty, income, education, housing, and inequality.

**Description:**  
This project uses SQL to process 2019 ACS data, calculate key metrics (poverty rate, income, unemployment, etc.), and rank states using window functions and case logic. The final dataset is visualized in Looker Studio with interactive maps and scorecards.

**Skills:**  
SQL joins, CTEs, window functions, CASE statements, aggregate functions, data type conversion, public data querying, dashboard design.

**Technology:**  
BigQuery, Looker Studio, GitHub, Google Cloud Console.

**Results:**  
Created a full-featured dashboard showing disparities in income, education, rent burden, and inequality across all U.S. states. Used SQL logic to categorize poverty levels, rank states, and feed geospatial visualizations.

### Gunnison Airport Flight Tracker Website
**Code:** [Gunnison Airport Tracker GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/gunnison-airport-tracker)  
**Live Report:** [Heroku App](https://gunnison-airport-tracker-28d8dfff50df.herokuapp.com)

**Goal:** To build a real-time flight tracking system for private flights near Gunnison, CO, leveraging the OpenSky Network API and PostgreSQL for data storage.

**Description:** This web application tracks the location, altitude, and status of aircraft flying near Gunnison Airport (KGUC). The project integrates OpenSky API for real-time flight data, stores flight information in a PostgreSQL database, and displays the data on an interactive, user-friendly interface. Private plane logs are stored and queried based on repeat sightings.

**Skills:** API integration, web development, database management, real-time data processing, interactive visualization.  
**Technology:** Node.js, Express.js, OpenSky Network API, PostgreSQL, Heroku, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

**Results:** Successfully built and deployed a functional flight tracker displaying real-time flights, with the ability to track and log private aircraft that fly over Gunnison regularly. The system fetches and updates flight data every hour, ensuring the live dashboard remains current.
