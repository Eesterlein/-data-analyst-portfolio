# Elissa Esterlein – Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Elissa. I bring a background in biology and medical research to the field of data analytics, with a strong interest in applying data-driven insights to health, environment, and public policy challenges.

After stepping away from research to raise my child and live off-grid in the Colorado Rockies, I’ve reignited my technical skills through modern tools like Python, geospatial analysis, and AI-assisted workflows. My passion for learning, curiosity about complex systems, and drive to uncover meaningful patterns have made data science an exciting new chapter in my career.

This portfolio showcases my work across a variety of domains — from analyzing personal fitness data, to exploring land ownership trends in Colorado, to building lightweight AI tools. These projects reflect my growing expertise in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling through code.

I'm actively building my skills through certifications, real-world projects, and public data challenges — and I’m excited to contribute to mission-driven organizations as a flexible, creative, and thoughtful data analyst.

## 🗂️ Portfolio Projects  
In this section, I list data analytics and AI projects with brief summaries and links to source code or hosted reports.

### 📊 Garmin Fitness Data Analysis  
**Code:** [Garmin Fitness Analysis Repository](https://github.com/Eesterlein/My-2024-Garmin-Data-Analysis-)  
**Live Report:** [GitHub Pages Site](https://eesterlein.github.io/My-2024-Garmin-Data-Analysis-/)

**Goal:** To uncover patterns in personal health data using Garmin fitness exports.

**Description:** This project explores trends in activity, calories, heart rate, sleep, and stress over the course of 2024. Using Python, I analyzed and visualized seasonality, correlations, and wellness insights from raw Garmin data.

**Skills:** data wrangling, time series analysis, statistical correlation, data storytelling.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Results:** Revealed a strong correlation between activity and calorie burn (0.89), seasonal changes in workout intensity, and a moderate link between resting heart rate and stress.

### 🧠 Local LLM Assistant Prototype  
**Code:** [Local LLM Chatbot Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/local-llm-agent)

**Goal:** To create a privacy-first AI assistant using locally hosted large language models (LLMs).

**Description:** Built a demo app using Ollama, LlamaIndex, and LangChain that simulates a policy chatbot trained on company handbooks. The agent can answer questions locally without needing an internet connection.

**Skills:** vector database indexing, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, local AI hosting.  
**Technology:** Python, Ollama, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Markdown, FastAPI (planned).

**Results:** Demonstrated how companies can use on-device models for internal knowledge queries without sharing data externally.

### 🌄 Colorado Land Ownership Analysis  
**Code:** [Colorado Land Ownership GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Eesterlein/colorado-land-ownership)  
**Live Report:** [GitHub Pages Site](https://eesterlein.github.io/colorado-land-ownership/)

**Goal:** To analyze the distribution of public vs. private land ownership across Colorado and explore trends in absentee ownership.

**Description:** This geospatial project combines COMaP shapefiles, parcel data, and assessor records to visualize land control by agency, ownership type, and residency.

**Skills:** geospatial analysis, public land data, mapping, data cleaning, visualization, storytelling.  
**Technology:** Python, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, ArcGIS, GitHub Pages.

**Results:** Found that 62.6% of Colorado is privately owned; in counties like Gunnison, over 76% is public land, but private parcels are increasingly owned by out-of-county residents and investment entities.

## 🎓 Education  
**Western State Colorado University**  
**Bachelor of Arts – Biology**  
*Gunnison, CO — 2013*
